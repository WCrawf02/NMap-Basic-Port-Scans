# üëÅÔ∏è NMap-Basic-Port-Scans

In this project, I am exploring the fundamentals of port scanning using Nmap, focusing on identifying which ports are open, listening, or closed on a target system. This is a crucial step in network reconnaissance and penetration testing. Through the TryHackMe **Nmap Basic Port Scans** module, I will be learning and applying different types of port scans such as TCP Connect, TCP SYN, and UDP port scans. These scans allow us to gather important information about the services running on a system and help identify potential vulnerabilities. My documentation will cover the usage of these scans, analysis of results, and insights into the effectiveness of each method.
